・ᕱ⑅ᕱ・I am officially diagnosed with Schizophrenia irl, though I maybe heavily medicated and going through therapy sessions, still go easy on me

![tumblr_inline_msbv3u3zet1rkldve540](https://github.com/Bunnistar/Bunnistar/assets/145001684/34d6098c-2b85-43f6-8734-1ba91acb1672)・ᕱ⑅ᕱ・I tend to say and do triggering things on rare occassions due to past traumas and coping

![tumblr_inline_msbv3u3zet1rkldve540](https://github.com/Bunnistar/Bunnistar/assets/145001684/34d6098c-2b85-43f6-8734-1ba91acb1672)・ᕱ⑅ᕱ・You can take inspirations on my skins in Ponytown, just don't copy the character by colors and hexes, you can however take inspo from the outfit and stuff
